# Contributing to Awesome Moltbot Skills

A curated list of skills for Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot). We organize links to skills hosted in the [official Moltbot skills repo]((https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills).

## Adding a Skill

### Entry Format

Add your skill to the end of the relevant category in `README.md`:

```markdown
- [skill-name]((https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/author/skill-name/SKILL.md) - Short description of what it does.
```

If an author has multiple skills in the same area, please don't add them one by one. Instead, link to the author's parent folder and write a general description. This keeps the list clean and avoids unnecessary clutter.

```markdown
- [author-skills]((https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/author) - Brief summary covering all skills.
```

### Where to Add

- Find the matching category in `README.md` and add your entry at the end of that section.
- If no existing category fits, add to the closest match or suggest a new category in your PR description.

### Requirements

- Skill must be published to the [Moltbot official skills repo]((https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills)
- Has documentation (SKILL.md)
- Description must be concise — 10 words or fewer
